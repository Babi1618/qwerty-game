HI! WELCOME TO MY QWERTY GAME (only for desktop)

You can play here: https://main--qwerty-game.netlify.app/

Here the #RULES of this #CHALLENGE: 
We have to create a #WEB-APP in which there is a keyboard layout and a word to write. 
The web app reads the keys pressed by the player: for each correct letter the score increases by 1, for each wrong letter the score decreases by 1. 
As we write the word, it is colored green. 
When the player presses the keys, we can associate a small animation on the single key present in the layout, simulating the pressure of the same.

Thanks for reading!
